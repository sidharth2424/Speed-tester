# 🧪 Bandwidth Monitor / Network Speed Tester

A simple Python-based client-server application that measures **upload and download speeds** between two machines over a TCP connection. This project helps you understand real-world networking concepts like **socket programming**, **throughput calculation**, and the **client-server model**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Measures **upload speed** from client to server
- Measures **download speed** from server to client
- Uses **TCP sockets**
- Calculates throughput in **Mbps (Megabits per second)**
- Can run locally or across a **LAN network**
